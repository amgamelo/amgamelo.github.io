                    <em>"By her side, on the little reading-desk, was a survival from the ages of litter-one book."</em><br/>
                    <br/> 
                    This was the Book of the Machine. In it were instructions against every possible contingency. <br/>
                    If you were hot or cold or dyspeptic or at a loss for a word, you go to the book, and it tells <br/>
                    you which button to press. The Central Committee published it. In accordance with a growing <br/>
                    habit, it was richly bound.<br/>

                    <strong>Book Ritual</strong><br/>
                    <em>say aloud</em> "O Machine!" <br/>
                    <em>raise the volume to your lips</em><br/>
                    <em>kiss the book three times</em> <br/>
                    <em>look up three times</em><br/>
                    <em>say your prayer</em><br/>
