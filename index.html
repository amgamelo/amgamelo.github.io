                        Some humanitarians protest, but he would never suit the life to which the Machine <br/>
                        has called him; In the dawn of the world we must be exposed on Mount Taygetus, <br/> 
                        in its twilight we will experience euthanasia, that the Machine may progress, that <br/>
                        the Machine may progress, that the Machine may progress eternally.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        "The Machine," they exclaimed, "feeds us and clothes us and houses us; through it we<br/> 
                        speak to one another, through it we see one another, in it we have our being. The Machine <br/>
                        is the friend of ideas and the enemy of superstition: the Machine is omnipotent, eternal; <br/>
                        blessed is the Machine." And before long this allocution was printed on the first page of <br/>
                        the Book, and in subsequent editions the ritual swelled into a complicated system of praise <br/>
                        and prayer. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Persecution. It did not break out, for reasons that will be set forward shortly. <br/>
                        All who did not accept the minimum known as "undenominational Mechanism" lived in danger of<br/> 
                        Homelessness, which meant death.<br/>
